To build the program, run:

$ make


Run the program using:

$ make run


To clean ie remove "a.out" file, run the command:

$ make clean


NOTE:

This C program doesn't expect and accept commands from a file. I tried to make it compatible with it but due to limited time and avoid losing marks, I had to submit it as a run time command input program. Sorry :(
